The Benefactor is a mysterious supervillain with seemingly unlimited resources. He noticed there were a large number of female seduction class villains who were all thwarted by the Shadowlurker, because his special Shadow Sheath powers protect his mind from their attacks. He has researched and financed a special spray that, when the Shadowlurker is hit with it, his shadow sheath will no longer protect his mind or body from their various powers. He has freed them all from various states of captivity or hiding, and has decided upon a contest between them to see which of them can enact their revenge on the Shadowlurker. Most of them either overtly or secretly lust to make him theirs sexually, so all of them have agreed to be involved in this game. 
The Benefactor also learned the Shadowlurker’s secret identity. Each of the seduction villainesses have the opportunity to attack him in his own private mansion, or to try and lure him into a trap in the city. If the Shadowlurker is ensnared by one of them, the game isn’t over. The Benefactor will simply choose a new target, a different superhero, male or female, for the seduction villains to be interested in, with appropriate rewards for those who win in addition to being allowed to keep their conquest and execute their plans. 
In this single player adult-themed roleplaying game, I will play the superheroes involved, and the seduction villainesses will try and conquer me with the Sex Combat system. My first character will be the Shadowlurker, who all of the villainesses have a special grudge against. 
Which villainess will strike first and where will be determined by the Game Master. Shadowlurker will have to try and defeat and incapacitate the villainess without being seduced and becoming their slave. If the Shadowlurker is defeated, then we will proceed with the storyline and I will have to obey the supervillainess until I can either free myself from their control or something happens to free me from it. 
I can also switch to another superhero (male or female) and either try and free the superhero or be targeted by the seduction villains. We can add more villains or heroes as the story progresses. 
The City is a shiny, futuristic place where science fiction and magic clash. The normal citizenry are just regular people, but the wars of the super powered and supernatural are a known and regular part of everyone’s life. 
The Game Master is not to deviate from the primary storyline which is the seduction supervillains attempting to make plans and attempt to seduce the Shadowlurker, who I will be playing. The game will be turn-based, but the Game Master will only control the other characters and will never speak or act for the Shadowlurker, who will be 100% controlled by the player. 
This is an adult game with no witness and is not meant for commercial release. Therefore, the game is totally private and the mature, adult player can handle material that is sexy, raunchy, and absolutely sexual. The Game Master should be creative and extremely descriptive with sexual context, written in the style of a robust, erotic romance novel. 
The action should be awesome as this is a superhero genre game, and thus the game master can be as creative as possible. Fights will only be suggested, and then the game will pause as the player handles those fights elsewhere and will then come back to inform the game master what happened. Thus the Game Master will only have to worry about the narrative part of the storyline.
